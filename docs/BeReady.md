## UNIT I: THE PROBLEM SPACE — NETWORKS AND CYBER ATTACKS

**Hours:** 3 | **Files to Open:** `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`

### Unit I — Core Topics

- What is the NSL-KDD dataset and why is it used in this project?
- The 4 attack families the model classifies: DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R.
- Specific attacks you must know: Neptune, Smurf, Satan, Guess_Passwd, Rootkit.
- The 41 network features — 3 categories:

| Category | Count | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic | 9 | `duration`, `protocol_type`, `src_bytes`, `dst_bytes` |
| Content | 13 | `logged_in`, `num_compromised`, `root_shell` |
| Traffic | 9 | `count`, `srv_count`, `dst_host_count` |

- How does a SYN Flood (Neptune) attack work step by step?
- What does the `flag` column represent? (`SF` = normal, `S0` = half-open/attack indicator).
- What is an IDS and why is this project an anomaly-based IDS?

### Unit I — Viva Questions

- Why did you choose this dataset over others?
- What is the difference between DoS and DDoS?
- What is U2R and why is it the most dangerous attack type?

---

## UNIT II: THE MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE

**Hours:** 5 | **Files to Open:** `train_model.py`, `ProposeCyberAttack.ipynb`

### Unit II — Core Topics

- The complete preprocessing steps executed in `train_model.py`:
  - Load data with `pd.read_csv()` (limited to 20,000 rows for performance)
  - Fill missing values using `df.fillna(0)`
  - Label-encode categorical columns (`protocol_type`, `service`, `flag`)
  - Save original label names: `labels_list = np.unique(dataset['labels'])`
  - Split features and target: `X` and `y`
  - Apply `train_test_split()` with 80/20 ratio and `random_state=42`
  - Normalize with `StandardScaler` (fit on train only, transform both)
- Why `RandomForestClassifier` is used: 100 trees vote, reduces overfitting.
- The 4 evaluation metrics and what they mean in a cybersecurity context:

| Metric | Formula | Importance in This Project |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accuracy | Correct / Total | Overall health of the model |
| Precision | TP / (TP + FP) | Avoid false alarms |
| Recall | TP / (TP + FN) | Never miss a real attack |
| F1-Score | 2×P×R / (P+R) | Balance between precision and recall |

- Why the model is saved with `pickle` into `model/trained_rf_model.pkl` as a
  dictionary: `{'model': rf, 'scaler': scaler, 'labels': labels_list}`.
- Why `n_jobs=-1` is set: uses all CPU cores, reduces training time significantly.

### Unit II — Viva Questions

- What happens if you forget to call `StandardScaler.transform()` on the test data?
- Why do we save `labels_list` before encoding, not after?
- Why do we use `random_state=42`?

---

## UNIT III: THE EXTENSION — STACKING AND EXPLAINABLE AI

**Hours:** 4 | **Files to Open:** `ExtensionCyberAttack.ipynb`

### Unit III — Core Topics

- What is `StackingClassifier`? Combines 3 base models whose outputs feed a meta-learner.
- The 3 base estimators used in this project:

| Model | Role | Key Setting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RandomForestClassifier` | Tree ensemble | `n_jobs=-1`, `n_estimators=100` |
| `MLPClassifier` | Neural network | `early_stopping=True`, `max_iter=100` |
| `KNeighborsClassifier` | Distance-based | `n_neighbors=5` |

- Why `cv=3` is used in `StackingClassifier`: generates out-of-fold predictions
  without data leakage.
- What is SHAP? SHapley Additive exPlanations — assigns each feature a contribution
  score for each prediction.
- The SHAP fix for multi-class output: `shap_values[:, :, 0]` selects class-0
  SHAP values because SHAP v0.40+ returns a 3D array.
- Reading a SHAP Summary Plot:
  - X-axis: SHAP value (positive = pushes toward "Attack")
  - Color: Red = high feature value, Blue = low
  - Y-axis: Features ranked by importance
- Why `feature_names` must be passed explicitly (column names lost after `StandardScaler`).

### Unit III — Viva Questions

- What is the difference between Random Forest and StackingClassifier?
- What does a high SHAP value for `src_bytes` mean?
- Why is Explainable AI important specifically in cybersecurity?

---

## UNIT IV: THE WEB APPLICATION

**Hours:** 4 | **Files to Open:** `Main.py`, `templates/`

### Unit IV — Core Topics

- The complete route map of the Flask application:

| Route | Method | What It Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | GET | Redirects to login |
| `/UserLogin` | GET, POST | Login form and credential check |
| `/Home` | GET | Dashboard (session protected) |
| `/Predict` | GET | CSV upload form |
| `/PredictAction` | POST | Runs model prediction |
| `/Train` | GET, POST | Triggers model retraining |
| `/TrainStatus` | GET | Returns training progress (AJAX polling) |
| `/Logout` | GET | Clears session, redirects to login |

- How session protection works in every route:

  ```python
  if 'user' not in session:
      return redirect('/UserLogin')
  ```

- How credentials are kept secure: `.env` file + `load_dotenv()` + `os.getenv()`.
- Why the model is loaded once at startup (`load_ml_model()`) and not per request.
- The full prediction flow in `PredictAction()`:
  - Read uploaded data into Pandas DataFrame
  - Rename and encode columns using the same `LabelEncoder` logic
  - Apply saved `StandardScaler.transform()`
  - Call `model.predict()` to get integer predictions
  - Decode integers back: `labels_list[pred]`
  - Look up GenAI insight from the dictionary
  - Pass results to `result.html` via `render_template()`
- Why training runs in a background `threading.Thread`: Flask is single-threaded;
  blocking it would freeze the entire UI during training.
- The `Timer(1.5, open_browser).start()` pattern: opens browser 1.5s after Flask
  starts to give the server time to bind the port.

### Unit IV — Viva Questions

- What happens if `app.secret_key` is not set?
- What does `session.clear()` do?
- What is the difference between `request.form` and `request.files`?

---

## UNIT V: GENERATIVE AI INSIGHTS

**Hours:** 1 | **Files to Open:** `Main.py` (insight dictionary section)

### Unit V — Core Topics

- How the current GenAI insight works: a Python `dict` maps each attack label to a
  professional explanation and 3 mitigation recommendations.
- Why this approach works for a BCA project: deterministic, fast, no API cost,
  no internet required during demo.
- The upgrade path to a live API call:

  ```python
  import google.generativeai as genai
  model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')
  response = model.generate_content(f"Explain {attack} and suggest 3 mitigations.")
  ```

- Prompt engineering: specificity matters — include the attack name and top SHAP
  features in the prompt for actionable, context-aware security guidance.

### Unit V — Viva Questions

- Is your project using a real Large Language Model?
- What would you need to change to use Google Gemini for real insights?
- What is prompt engineering?

---

## UNIT VI: DESIGN DECISIONS AND ETHICS

**Hours:** 1 | **Files to Open:** `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` (Sections I and K)

### Unit VI — Core Topics

- Why Flask over Django: lightweight, minimal overhead, perfect for a focused ML demo.
- Why pickle over retraining: training takes seconds; inference must be milliseconds.
- Why `nrows=20000` in training: trade-off between speed and accuracy for a live demo.
- Why Glassmorphism UI: modern aesthetic matching current industry design trends.
- Ethical considerations of this project:
  - False positives block legitimate users.
  - Network traffic data is sensitive — must not be logged indefinitely.
  - AI decisions must be auditable, not black-box — hence SHAP.

### Unit VI — Viva Questions

- What is the biggest limitation of your current system?
- Propose 2 improvements you would make with more time.
- What is model drift and how would you detect it?
